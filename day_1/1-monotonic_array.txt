Clarifying Questions
Is an empty array monotonic? Yes
Is an array with single element monotonic? Yes

Test Cases
[1,2,2,3] => true (monotony increasing)
[3,2,2,1] => true (monotony decreasing)
[3] => true
[3,3] => true
[] => true
[1,4,7,3,5] => false


Monotonic non increasing means moving from index 0 to n, the elemensts are not increasing
i.e. array[i] >= array[i+1]

Monotonic non decreasing means moving from index 0 to n, the elemensts are not decreasing
i.e. array[i] <= array[i+1]

Three Scenarios
[3,_,_,_,_,9] => monotonic if all values in between are greater than 3 and less than 9
[3,_,_,_,_,3] => monotonic if all values in between are equal to 3
[3,_,_,_,_,-9] => monotonic if all values in between are less than 3 and greater than -9

Pseudocode
compare the first and last elements to identify which scenario as above
loop through the array and determine the solution
