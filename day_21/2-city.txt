# Question

A company is planning to interview 2n people. Given the array costs where costs[i] = [a_cost, b_cost], the cost of flying the ith person to city A is a_cost and the cost of flying the ith person to city B is b_cost. Return theminimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city.(costs has even number of elements and number of elements >= 2)

## Examples

costs = [[5,20],[30,100],[400,30],[50,10] => 75
costs = [[20,700],[400,50],[900,600],[200,150],[800,100],[500,450]] => 1470

## Approach
optimisation problem
1) can use dynamic programming
2) can use greedy approach

two choices for each person; fly to city A or city B
constraint is fly half of the people to city A and the other half to city B

## Greedy Algorithm

two choices for each person; fly to city A or city B
minimize the the cost and 
fly half of the people to city A and the other half to city B

## Pseudocode

sort array in ascending => costs[i][0] - costs[i][1]
guaranteed array will have even elements hence identify the mid and,
send 1st half to city A and other half to city B
return total cost
