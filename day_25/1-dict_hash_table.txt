# Question 1: Two Sum
You are given an array of integers and another integer targetValue.
Write a funtion that will take these inputs and return the indices of the two
integers in the array that add up to targetValue.


## Clarifying Questions
What if no two integers add upto targetValue? Return an empty array
Will multiple pairs add up to targetValue? No, at most one pair
Are all integers positive? No, both negative and positive values are posible
Are the integers distinct? Yes
What if an empty array is given? Return an empty array
Can I add the same element twice to get targetValue? No

## Test Cases
[2,7] tv=9 => [0,1]
[2,7,3,-1,4] tv=2 => [2,3]
[2,7,3,-1,4] tv=100 => []
[27] tv=27 => []
[] tv=4 => []

## Method 1 : Bruteforce
[2,7,3,-1,4] tv = 2
pointer at index 0(i) and pointer at index 1(j)
nested for loop, to check if j = tv - 1
increment i and j for the next iteration

## Method 1 : Optimized Using Hashtable
As array is traversed, check if neededValue is in the hashtable
pointer i at array[0] and if neededValue is in hashtable,
if not add value as key and index as value
Note: neededValue = target - i
