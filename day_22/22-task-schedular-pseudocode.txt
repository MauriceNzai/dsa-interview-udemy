1. traverse tasks and calculate frequencies
    get highest-frequency and number-of-tasks-with-highest-frequency
2. parts = highest frequency - 1
3. slots-in-parts = parts * (n - (max-count - 1))
4. remaining-tasks = length-tasks - (highest-freq * max-count)
5. empty-slots =  slots-in-parts -  remaining-tasks
