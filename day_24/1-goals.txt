Day 24 Goals
Welcome to Day 24 of the DSA Coding Challenge.

Today's Goals (Arrays):

Question 1: Rotate Array - Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Question 2: Container with most Water - You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water(depth is constant across containers). Return the area(that the 2 lines and the X axis make) of container which can store the max amount of water. Notice that you may not slant the container.

Stay Consistent. All the best !
